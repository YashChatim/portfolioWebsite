            <p class="card-text">
                An e-learning ASP.NET web application similar to Treehouse group with a team consisting of 10 members.
                The application used MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern and Razor mark-up syntax to embed
                server-based C# code, HTML and CSS into web pages. Microsoft's SQL Azure Database was used to host the
                database in cloud, whereas Bootstrap was used to design the web pages. To build the complex application,
                the team used scrum as its collaborative agile development framework and distributed their work in sprints.
                To plan, track and manage their agile, and their application, the team used Jira. Git was used as their version control
                and GitHub to host their git repositories.
